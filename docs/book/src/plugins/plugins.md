# Plugins

Kubebuilder's architecture is fundamentally plugin-based.
This design enables the Kubebuilder CLI to evolve while maintaining
backward compatibility with older versions, allowing users to opt-in or
opt-out of specific features, and enabling seamless integration
with external tools.

By leveraging plugins, projects can extend Kubebuilder and use it as a
library to support new functionalities or implement custom scaffolding
tailored to their users' needs. This flexibility allows maintainers
to build on top of Kubebuilderâ€™s foundation, adapting it to specific
use cases while benefiting from its powerful scaffolding engine.

Plugins offer several key advantages:

- **Backward compatibility**: Ensures older layouts and project structures remain functional with newer versions.
- **Customization**: Allows users to opt-in or opt-out for specific features (i.e. [Grafana][grafana-plugin] and [Deploy Image][deploy-image] plugins)
- **Extensibility**: Facilitates integration with third-party tools and projects that wish to provide their own [External Plugins][external-plugins], which can be used alongside Kubebuilder to modify and enhance project scaffolding or introduce new features.

**For example, to initialize a project with multiple global plugins:**

```sh
kubebuilder init --plugins=pluginA,pluginB,pluginC
```

**For example, to apply custom scaffolding using specific plugins:**

```sh
kubebuilder create api --plugins=pluginA,pluginB,pluginC
OR
kubebuilder create webhook --plugins=pluginA,pluginB,pluginC
OR
kubebuilder edit --plugins=pluginA,pluginB,pluginC
```

This section details the available plugins, how to extend Kubebuilder,
and how to create your own plugins while following the same layout structures.
